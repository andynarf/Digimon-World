     <h1>INTRO</h1>

     <p><strong>If you just want an easy way to tell how to evolve into a Digimon, use this <a href="https://phoenix-staffel.de/digimon/DigimonWorld/evolution.html">Tool</a></strong></p>
    
     <p>To use this guide properly you should read the explanation of the mechanics that are preceding the raw values, as you may not understand their meaning and how to use them properly otherwise.</p>

     <p>The evolution system of Digimon World is a quite a complex piece of game mechanics and unfortunately no guide so far has managed to get it right. This guide is intended to not only help you to get the Digimon you want, but also to help you understand how the entire system works â€“ and how to abuse it's subtleties.</p>

     <p>Still, I can not guarantee for the 100% correctness of everything .</p>

     <p>There is also an easy to use tool in the <a href="end#links">Links</a> section, where you just have to enter your current stats and it will calculate your result.</p>
